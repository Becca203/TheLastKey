## Description
The Last Key it’s a competitive 2D platformer where two players face off against each other to reach the exit door. The game features a symmetric environment (or set of environments) in which players must compete to obtain the only key that allows access to the exit. The minimum condition to win the match is to exit through the player’s corresponding door.
